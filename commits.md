In open source projects, a commit is a specific change made to the source code of a software project. It is a way for developers to track and manage changes to the codebase. 
Each commit typically includes a message that describes the changes made, as well as the author and date of the commit.

There are several types of commits that developers can make, including:
**Bug fixes:** These commits address issues or bugs in the codebase that have been identified by developers or users.
**Feature additions:** These commits add new functionality or features to the software project.
**Refactoring:** These commits involve restructuring or optimizing the codebase to improve performance, readability, or maintainability.
**Documentation updates:** These commits involve updating the documentation or comments within the codebase to improve clarity and understanding.

Commit metrics can be useful to users in several ways. 
For example, by analyzing commit frequency and size, users can get a sense of how active and productive the development team is. 
Additionally, by looking at the types of commits being made, users can gain insights into the priorities and focus of the development team, as well as the overall health and stability of the codebase. Finally, commit metrics can be used to identify areas of the codebase that may be in need of additional attention or improvement.
The matrics is usefull for OSS project developers, contributors and other stackholders.
